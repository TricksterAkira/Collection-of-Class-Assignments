# Collection-of-Class-Assignments
This is a repository created to learn GitHub while also showcasing of a few assignments I created for a class 
### Assignment-5  
The goal of this assignment was to learn how to code buttons through various methods, while also trying to make it fit a theme of either
a television or a desktop. 

In my project I decided to try and fit the theme of desktop, and incorporate my buttons in a way that mimicked applications and a button that had a similar function to the Windows button. Another goal I had for this project
was to try and work with a limited color scheme to try and apply principles of design. There were other principles of design I attempted to incoporate in this project like scale, repetition, and proximity. 
Two buttons in this project are interacted with by clicking the mouse button, specifically the button mimicking the Windows button and the application that is one over from the left and one down from the top.
The third button, which is the application in the top left corner of the desktop, is interacted with by pressing a specific key while the mouse is within the bounds of the square. The key I chose to use for this is 'F'.
Each of these buttons then open up shapes that mimick windows or applications that could be found on an actual desktop. 

### Assignment-7
The goal of this assignment was to learn to create our own function that drew a shape that was a combonation of shapes, and create a function that returned a value then print that to the console. Then we had to create a loop
to make multiple copies of the drawing. We also had to use other functions to update aspects of the drawing created by the function. Another goal was to learn how to use the push and pop functions, to isolate changes to a 
specific part of a drawing. The themes to choose for this project were wheater or retro games, which I chose the latter. 

I chose to try and work with the retro games theme for this, and was inspired by the game _Snake_. My function drew the apples that appear, and I utilized the rotate function to create an apple shape with ellipses. Then
I used the scale function to make the apples increase in size. To create the snake I used arrays that utlized the mouse's position, and then displaced it to create a trailing body.

### Assignment-10
The goal of this assignment was to find an extended p5.js library and use three unique functions from that library in your project. 

The extended library I chose to use for this assignment was [p5.Polar](https://github.com/liz-peng/p5.Polar), which adds functions that allow you to create shapes that use a circle to determine their position. There are also
functions that allow you to create multiple shapes around the circle, making it easier to create things like optical illusions. I used the single shape functions, specifcally polygon, square, ellipse, and triangle, to draw
most of the shapes in my project instead of the functions incoporated in p5.js already that draw them. I did this to work with the library as much as I could. I then used one of the multiple shape fuctions to add interest to the drawing so it was not just a mask on a solid background. There was no specific theme proposed for this assignment, so I tried to draw the character Clem from [_Warframe_](https://www.warframe.com/?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=20408101164&utm_term=151521101003&utm_content=682630274386&gsc=1&utm_medium=g_5651636&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA3Na5BhAZEiwAzrfagJQpATwe7x5OBrKFT3R3ClR6E5sOW3grTjT6HTB0TR8g7XpG5RTYHxoCVVsQAvD_BwE&wbraid=Cj4KCAiA3Na5BhBWEi4A_blCuiROXatq43njc0pfIAS_m4YWDbf-WEeT1EGhFJ8D3LmnwpvK1MPYan9YGgIt8Q) through coding.
