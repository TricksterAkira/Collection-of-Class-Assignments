This is a repository created to learn GitHub while also showcasing of a few assignments I created for a class 
### Assignment-5  
The goal of this assignment was to learn how to code buttons through various methods, while also trying to make it fit a theme of either
a television or a desktop. 

In my project I decided to try and fit the theme of desktop, and incorporate my buttons in a way that mimicked applications and a button that had a similar function to the Windows button. Another goal I had for this project
was to try and work with a limited color scheme to try and apply principles of design. There were other principles of design I attempted to incoporate in this project like scale, repetition, and proximity. 
Two buttons in this project are interacted with by clicking the mouse button, specifically the button mimicking the Windows button and the application that is one over from the left and one down from the top.
The third button, which is the application in the top left corner of the desktop, is interacted with by pressing a specific key while the mouse is within the bounds of the square. The key I chose to use for this is 'F'.
Each of these buttons then open up shapes that mimick windows or applications that could be found on an actual desktop.
